# Comment Toxicity Detection

This project demonstrates building a deep neural network from scratch to detect toxic comments.

- **Focus**: The goal is to gain hands-on experience with NLP pipelines and TensorFlow basics.
- **Disclaimer**: Due to GPU limitations and better architectures available, the model is not extensively trained or optimized for performance.
- **Technologies Used**: Python and TensorFlow
